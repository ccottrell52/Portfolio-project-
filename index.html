              <p> I was born in Kaysville, Utah to two wondeful parents. My father worked as a police officer for many years while my mom raised us at home. 
                I grew up loving sports and played four all through high school. I went on to recieve a scholorship to play college soccer and not too long after recieved a career ending injury. 
              </p>

             <p> I have a huge love for the outdoors and being in nature. I love to fish and hunt and ride horses.
              I have a wife named Zoe and a dog named Daisy. My wife Zoe has a degree in communications and makes her living by doing PR work.
             </p>
            
              <p> I previously had pursued a few ideas for work but the tech field always stuck out to me because of how stable it was. 
                One of my main goals has always been to get a job where i can constantly learn and grow and make enough to provide for my family so here i am! 
                I currently work for foreUp golf software.
